Vraptor Hypermedia relations enhanced!

Hypermedia relations model changed in order to help your javascript code to be more readable an easy to do.

Instead of a json like the following one using RestfulSerializationJSON...

link : {
  rel : "delete",
  href : "http://host/resource/id"
}

... you get a JSON like this:

link : {
  "delete" : {
    method : "DELETE",
    url : "/resource/id"
  }
}

This model is pretty much complient to all common ajax javascript APIs available. Good examples are Angular and jQuery.
